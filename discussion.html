                    <h2><b>BREAKTHROUGH CASE STUDY FOR LANDSCAPE DESIGNERS</b></h2>
                    <p>In 2015, <b>Wilfredo P. Rico</b>, the owner of the landscape company Rico's Garden Landscaping in the Philippines, felt that his marketing efforts were stuck.
                        While Wilfredo advertised in magazines and newspapers, he found that print ads proved an ineffective use of his marketing money. Online, he redesigned his website multiple times, but the changes were merely to keep up with digital look his existing online presence did nothing to take advantage of the incredible lead-generating power of the Internet.
                        Even more challenging, his greatest number of new leads came in during the peak season which is the summer months the busiest time of year for a landscape company and fell off during other seasons. This meant Wilfredo had to spend precious time responding to prospect inquiries at the exact time he most needed to be directly helping his existing clients by providing his services in the field. During the off seasons, he struggled to keep his team busy. 
                        Adding to these difficulties was the fact that he had no way of knowing which of these potential new prospects were seriously interested in working with him, and which were at the very beginning stages of the process and merely wanted to find out more information about him and his company. “I was exhausted and feeling dissatisfied with the unpredictability of my selling. I felt like I was always racing between actually doing my work, and selling my work. The problem I needed to solve was I needed to make selling easier.”</p>
                    <p>When Willy contacted us for help, one fact immediately became clear: Content powered by the inbound marketing methodology was the key solution to Wilfredo's problem but only if it was organized and positioned correctly.</p>
                    <h3>We developed a plan of action:</h3>
                        <p><i>*identifying Wilfredo's ideal client;</i></p>
                        <p><i>*digitizing his existing sales process;</i></p>
                        <p><i>*designing a new, content-centered website;</i></p>
                        <p><i>*repurposing old blog content;</i></p>
                        <p><i>*creating informative ebooks;</i></p>
                        <p><i>*and even developing a new, automated phone call scheduling solution.</i></p>
                       <p>The results were impressive. Leads are now up 625 percent from when the partnership first started, and 70 percent of initial calls result in a sale and even better, they're the exact type of client that is the best fit for Wilfredo's business.</p>
                       <p>Sounds like a dream come true, right?</p>
                       <p>Well, there's great news your business can achieve the same level of success, too. The secret to it all is this: a defined, scalable system for marketing your business online.</p>
                        <p>And that's exactly what we specialize in at <b>Jean Tan Social Media Strategy</b>.</p>
                        <p>Trades businesses struggle to grow each and every day. Their business may not be consistent and most have difficulty growing.</p>

                            <h2>WHY DO TRADE BUSINESSES NEED TO MARKET THEIR BUSINESS ONLINE</h2>
                            <h3>AT THIS POINT YOU MAY THINK</h3>
                            <p><i>“Sure, an online marketing system sounds great, but my types of services are unique to each client, and so I need to sell them in person. This would never work for me.”</i></p>
                            <p>If you are feeling that way, you're certainly not alone. But we know from experience working directly with trades businesses that a digital strategy can not only be successfully implemented in your own business, but can be the key to accelerating your sales and revenue.</p>
                            <p>The reason for this is simple, and profound: Today's digital world has completely transformed buyer behavior regardless of your industry. And as a result, clients are now in control of the conversation.</p>
                            <p>Ten or even five years ago, you likely would have been just fine relying on your traditional process, conducting sales person to person. But now, prospects are using the Internet and social media to become educated about their options before ever contacting a company or making a purchase. As one example, just think of all the times you've seen people ask for a recommendation for a plumber or contractor in your local Facebook group. And you can be sure this is happening whether your own business is online or not.</p>
                            <h3>IF YOU HAVE THIS SAME HESITATION</h3>
                            <p><i>“I had been doing this for such a long time, my sales process was innate,” he says. “But Jean Tan Strategy proved to me that while the specific interactions are unique from client to client, there's always a core process for how you sell. And that's connected to your services, your brand, the 'why' of you as the owner.”</i></p>
                            
                            <h2>THE PROCESS TO MARKET A TRADES BUSINESS ONLINE</h2>
                            <p>The process to market a trades business online requires content plus a methodology for engaging visitors to your website. It is as simple as that. When a skilled content strategist works with you, they are able to turn your description of your sales process, why people buy from you and your differentiation, into a content plan.</p>
                            <p>It is a mistake to simply place the content onto your website. Static content does not engage the modern client. It has to follow an approach that gives them the information one step at a time while nurturing them to a discussion with your company.</p>

                            <h2>ENTER THE INBOUND MARKETING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
                            <p>To unlock the true revenue-generating power of today's digital environment, it's key that you implement the correct system. The best methodology to achieve it is inbound marketing.</p>
                          
                            <img src="x.png" alt="Nature" class="image" width="600" height="400">

                            <p>Inbound marketing is a methodology for bringing clients directly to you, rather than you searching for them. It accomplishes this through the creation of custom, targeted content designed to exactly meet the client needs at each stage of their buying journey. This content is then delivered to them on demand using efficient and cost-effective marketing automation tools</p>
                            <p>By creating this type of content, you're not only delivering potential new clients exactly what they need at the exact moment they want it, but you're also positioning yourself as an authority in your industry.</p>
                            <p>This approach to marketing your business online is especially beneficial if your services include large-scale projects such as home additions, renovations, or upgrades that require clients to make a significant investment. For projects like these, your clients will be especially concerned about finding a business that they can trust.</p>
                            <p>By being a source of clear, credible information, you can prove to these new prospects that are unfamiliar with you that you are an experienced business that they will derive significant value and a successful project.</p>
                            <p>In addition, not all trades businesses are adept at using digital technology. Implementing an <b>inbound marketing strategy</b> will make your business stand out among competitors that don't have a strong online presence and provide your business with even more of a competitive advantage.</p>

                            <h2>WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN IMPLEMENTING INBOUND MARKETING</h2>
                            <p>When you make the decision to implement inbound marketing for your trades business, your first step will be to decide exactly who your ideal client is—after all, you can’t create the perfect content for your perfect client if you don’t know just who that person is in the first place and what problems or needs they must address. This profile is called a <b>buyer persona</b>.</p>

                            <h2>FIND THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A BUYER PERSONA TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR YOUR BUSINESS</h2>
                            <i><p>“I realized I had a particular type of client I liked to work with, and Jean Tan Strategy helped me identify all of the traits and characteristics of this client,” he says. “They then helped me build this wonderful net using content to not only capture this ideal client, but also filter out the people who didn’t align with my work. <b>And now I’m finding most of my calls are exactly the type of client I want to work for.”</b></p></i>
                            <p>Once you've identified your ideal client, your next step will be to clarify and digitize exactly how you sell. <b>Your goal is to create a digital sales funnel that moves clients through each phase of the buying journey: awareness, consideration, and decision.</b></p>

One of the great things Jean Tan Strategy helped me implement was a system so prospects could schedule a phone call with me. Once they consumed all of my content and decided they wanted to talk to me, they had a way to drive the decision. When I get on the phone, they’re so excited to talk to me. When I’m trying to close a sale on the phone, they’re so primed and ready.”</i></p>
